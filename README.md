# GINI Is Not an IDE

But lets you build one: transparent, user friendly, productive.

GINI doesn't try to be a better vim, emacs or vscode but tries to
implement a different approach to the subject of creating, manipulating
and processing structured (i.e. parsable) text.  To achieve above goals
GINI implements
- a context oriented user interface for increased transparency, user
  friendliness and productivity
- a simple yet powerful integration into the system to process
  structured text.
- a generic parser-engine to define lexer and parser aiding the
  creation and manipulation of structured text with pretty printing,
  (code) spell checking, renaming, auto-completion, parameterized
  skeletons (aka snippets) etc.

See the [road map](roadmap.md) for an outline of the implementation
process.  The specifics of the implementation are precised and worked
out along the implementation process.
