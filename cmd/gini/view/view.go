Package view provides gini's user interface.  A gini-ui is made up of a
context bar and columns while a column consists of splits.  A split is
a component like an Editor.  For example the initial view of gini
executed inside its repository shows in one column and one split the
introductory help file.  This split is an Editor instance allowing to
edit the help file.  Further more on top in the first line the context
bar for displayed editable help files is shown:

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ln: 0  cl: 0  mod:cmd  hlp/index.gnh        [messages]           â€¢ |
