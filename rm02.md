# version 0.2

## minimal (global) help-context implementation

## minimal (global) settings-context implementation

## extend editor commands and context bar by "til occurrence of"

"til occurrence of" should then be combined with the move (m), copy (c)
and delete (d) commands to express "move/copy/delete until the 
occurrence of "42".  To realize that the move, copy and delete commands
have an input box in their respective context bar.

### modified behavior of the context bar

- Esc leave context bar discard/undo all user input associated with
  the last context.
- Enter leaves context bar applying/keeping effect of user input
- jk in input box (e.g. context-bar) switches to mini command mode
  mini command mode supports i/h/l/H/l/c/C/d/D/p/P whereas
  - i switches back into insert mode
  - h move one character left
  - l move one right
  - H move left to the first occurrence of next character input
  - L move right to the first occurrence of the next character input
  - c copy character sequence to the right until the first occurrence
      of the next character input.
  - C copy character sequence to the left until the first occurrence
      of the next character input.
  - d delete character sequence to the right until the first occurrence
      of the next character input.
  - D delete character sequence to the left until the first occurrence
      of the next character input.
  - p paste last copy/deletion after current cursor position
  - P paste last copy/deletion before current cursor position 
  Providing as "next character input" ^ or $ executes the mini-command
  until the input beginning or end respectively.
