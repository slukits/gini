# version 0.2

## minimal (global) help-context implementation

## minimal (global) settings-context implementation

## extend editor commands by "til occurrence of", move, copy, delete

"til occurrence of" should then be combined with the move, copy and
delete commands hence it should be possible to express "move until the
occurrence of "42".  To realize that the move, copy and delete commands
have an input box in their respective context bar

    'search text' ␣  word end  next word  line end  including
